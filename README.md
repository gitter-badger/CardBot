# TutorialBot
TutorialBot is a ready to edit, user bot that you can download and change!

## How to use
Go into the `lib/config/settings.json` file and edit all of the required parameters. If you are not using a MySQL Database, then just leave the `mysql` part of the file blank! If you don't know how to make a Discord Bot, then learn it because you probably won't be able to make it if you don't even know the most basic part! (No offense)

_Note: Make sure the token is set to the token of the bot you want to control!_
